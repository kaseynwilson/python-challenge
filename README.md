PyBank Analysis:

For this Analysis I used a dataset that contained fields for date (month/year) and profit/losses for the time period. I created a Python script that analyzes this financial data and provides the following data: 
  1. The total number of months included in the dataset. 
  2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. 
  3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.  
  4. The average change in "Profit/Losses" of the changes.  
  5. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. 
  6. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

  3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
  4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
